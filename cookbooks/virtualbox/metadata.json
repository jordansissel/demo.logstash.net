Sorry about that. You can always assign the URL if you know which file you want through the \"url\" attribute, and the recipe will do the right thing, though by default this attribute is an empty string.\n\nThe following attributes are used to build up the full source URL:\n\n* `node['virtualbox']['urlbase']` - Base URL through the directory on the VirtualBox mirror. Default is on virtualbox.org's mirror, in the 4.0.8 directory.\n* `node['virtualbox']['version']` - This is the base virtualbox file name up through the version. Slightly misleading, but there you have it.\n* `node['virtualbox']['arch']` - Used to determine which architecture in the filename, for Ubuntu/Debian distributions.\n\nOtherwise, you can specify this one, perhaps in your role:\n\n* `node['virtualbox']['url]` - The full URL of the virtualbox download. Use this if you want to specify a particular file to download. Default is an empty string. If this is a non-empty string, the recipe will attempt to use it as the download source.\n\n## Ubuntu\n\nThe versioning in Ubuntu is slightly different - it's just the version suffix on\nthe package name (e.g. virtualbox-4.0). The cookbook attributes of interest are:\n\n* `node['virtualbox']['version']` - the version suffix of the package name,\n    `virtualbox-X.X`. Valid options at the moment are \"3.2\" and \"4.0\"\n* `node['virtualbox']['open_source_edition']` - If false, adds Sun's repositroy\n    and installs the proprietary version (with extended USB support, among other\n    things)\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude the virtualbox default recipe in a role run list. If you want to install from a different source URL, provide it with the url attribute, such as:\n\n    name \"role_for_vbox\"\n    default_attributes(\"virtualbox\" => { \"url\" => \"http://url.to/your/vbox.pkg\" })\n    run_list(\"recipe[virtualbox]\")\n\nContributions\n======\n\nThe source for this cookbook is hosted on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/peplin/virtualbox-cookbook).
